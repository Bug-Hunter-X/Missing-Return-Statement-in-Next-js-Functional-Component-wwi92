# Missing Return Statement in Next.js Functional Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications: a missing `return` statement in a functional component.  The error occurs because functional components *must* return JSX.  Failure to do so will result in a runtime error.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about` - you'll see an error in the browser console.

## Solution

Ensure that all functional components in your Next.js application explicitly return JSX.  Even if the JSX is empty, you should explicitly return a null value or an empty div.
